Mousetrap v1.0 README 

Mousetrap v1.0
a small utility to trap the mouse inside the window it's currently hovering 
over

I wrote this because I like to play games in a window and some games when run 
with WINE don't properly lock the mouse to the window, like Starcraft II for 
instance.

Depends on libX11, notify-send and rw access to /tmp

Get Started:
	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
	git clone https://github.com/gholken/Mousetrap.git
	cd Mousetrap
	make

Usage:
	put the mousetrap binary somewhere in your path
	setup a hotkey to run the mousetrap bin (I use xfce keyboard settings)
	running it once locks the mouse to whatever window is under the mouse
	running it a second time kills the previous one and unlocks the mouse

Options:
	mousetrap -h -n -t x -b x -l x -r x
 	[-h] display this message 
	[-n] turn off notify 
	[-t offset_top=34] set offset from top of window
	[-b offset_bot=12] set offset from bottom of window
	[-l offset_left=12] set offset from left side of window
	[-r offset_right=12] set offset from right side of window

tested on Xubuntu 14.04

Known issues:
-If you move the window, the locked area does not move with the window
-You can't specify negative values for the border offsets
-Makes Xorg use excessive cpu from XQueryPointer() calls
